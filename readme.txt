== Description ==

This is an extension to the BlockAlyzer - Adblock counter plugin that uses its developer hooks to add a basic redirect page for Adblock users. This plugin requires BlockAlyzer to be installed and running.  Over the last couple of years Ad block browser extensions have become really popular - one of my sites had over 60% of its users running Ad block. This is not good for advertising revenue and Adsense earnings. 

This basic version can be set to redirect Adblock users to a page where you can ask people to turn off or pause their Adblock while on your site. It also allows you to choose which post type for running the Adblock on. I recommend you do not ue page as a post type to fire the Stop Adblock extension on as this can cause an infinite loop when trying to log in or when being redirected to the Stop Adblock redirect page.

This extension wil only run on single pages of the post type you choose. This allows people to visit your home page or category pages to  get an idea of what your site offers without being redirected. I put in a post type filter because I run a woocommerce shop on my sites and I did not want people visiting the shop to be constantly redirected when shopping.

The latest version with more options is available at http://wp.ypraise.com. The latest version allows you to choose more than one post type and also allows for filtering on capabilties. This is useful if you have paid membership and you don't want to redirect paying members who have adblock running.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this plugin? =

Go to the settings page and fill in the required information: 
1. The Wordpress page you want to redirect Adblock users to.
2. The post type you want the Stop Adblock extension to fire on.

= The redirect does not fire on category or tag pages etc =

That's right it does not fire. The Stop Adblock only fires on single pages. This allows visitors to see your home page and categories etc to get a flavour of what your site is about without being redirected.

= How big an improvement in earnings can I expect? =
 
Every site is different so I can not say. But on one of my sites I used to have over 60% of visitors using Adblock type browser extensions. That is now down to under 20%. Yes I've lost about 12% of page views as not everyone is willing to turn off Adblock to view pages but Adsense earmings are up over 30%. But every site is different.
